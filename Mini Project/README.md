This code was written by Ahmad Aiman Mohd Nazir (17060060) for computational physics course mini project. 
In this code we are going to solve for nonhomogenous linear ODEs where 
it genaral form can be written as follow my'' + by' + ky = f(x) and
for this ODEs, the physics problem that we are going to solve is related to 
forced vibration on the spring. Liner ODEs is y'' + 8y' +16y = 8sin(4x), 
the exact solution of this ODEs is y(x) = 1/4e^(-4x) + xe^(-4x) -1/4cos(4x)
